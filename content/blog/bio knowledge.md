How many of us have purged our offices only to toss hundreds of printed publications with scribbles in the margins and key-thoughts Sharpied®? Today we browse through publications online with our iPhones and iPads, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V into Notes but still, the words, the conclusions, the novel methods, the hypotheses remain disconnected from one author, one publication to the next. The challenge is taking all that scattered knowledge and building a concise user-friendly network on which you can base your hypothesis.

**What is BEL?**

The [Biological Expression Language (BEL)](https://bel.bio/) is an open standards-based language representing biological context and observations in a computable form. It captures knowledge gained from thousands of scientific publications and databases into composable statements, easily readable by biologists. The knowledge extracted includes the relationships between biological entities such as proteins, enzymes, mRNA, and metabolites. Each BEL statement can be assembled with related observations to build causal and correlative relationships;** a network of knowledge.** This powerful modeling provides customized knowledge to drive critical informed Go/NoGo decisions both efficiently and cost-effectively.

Modeling with BEL is not necessarily discovering new knowledge but reconstructing past and current knowledge into new discoverable relationships and unveiling new druggable targets. As more knowledge is brought into context, the biological knowledge network grows.

[**BioDati — Powering Network Biology](https://biodati.com/)**

BioDati customers have access to one of the largest computable biological knowledge bases in the world. Our services and platform, the most powerful BEL editor in the world, provides all the tools needed to allow our users to share, collaborate and focus on science.

BioDati now provides over 2 million pieces of manually curated knowledge spanning across multiple species, including human and rodents. Moreover, because this knowledge is computable, we can frame it to your species of interest. See why taking a context-specific, knowledge-based network modeling approach with a *reusable, shareable and computable* network is the most efficient way to integrate customized scientific knowledge around your research program.
